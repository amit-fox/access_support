# Slack boat to caputure conversation from a chat or group

# Steps to setup application

Create below keys from slack API developer page

    SIGNIN_SECRET
    AUTH_TOKEN

Create `support_channel` channel via slack scope config page.
Select scopes that are needed for the application ,
**OAuth & Permissions**

> _BOT token scope_
> `app_mentions:read` , `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `chat:write`, `chat:write.customize`

> _User token scope_
> `chat:write` `im:history`

**Event Subscriptions**

> Subscribe to bot events  
>  `app_mention` `message.channels`

> Subscribe to events on behalf of users
> `message.im`

After every changes related to scopes app needs to reinstall , slack will ask for it
`support_channel` is used to request for the request form for access

# How to start application locally ?

1. Clone the application here

2. Add SIGNIN_SECRET and AUTH_TOKEN to test.env file

3. install packages via `npm i`

4. you need to deploy application to some running server of install ngrok that can work as proxy for local development server

5. once ngrok is installed or app is deployed configure request urls as per the scope
   i.e. for interactive messages :
   https://api.slack.com/apps/A03SW2QRCQ3/interactive-messages?
   in case using ngrok the url generated by it looks something like below
   https://b5b3-2402-8100-2354-f950-40a1-385-def5-9f47.in.ngrok.io

6. after that do `npm start`
